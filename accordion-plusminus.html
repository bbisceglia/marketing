<li><strong><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2" class="accordion-toggle collapsed">How is this program like the residential MPH programs offered by GW?</a></strong></li>
<div id="collapse2" class="collapse">
  The MPH@GW has the same selective admissions criteria as that of the on-campus programs. MPH@GW leverages the same world-class, full-time faculty who teach other GW degree programs, and the subject matter is based on the curriculum delivered on campus. Students in the program enjoy the benefits of being a GW graduate student, including access to library resources, student services, career services and a global network of well-connected and successful GW alumni. Graduates earn the same prestigious GW degree as graduates of our traditional, full-time MPH programs and are able to participate in GWâ€™s on-campus commencement.</p>
