    Framing the Social Context of High Needs Schools (Social Context) prepares candidates to understand the relationship between the actions of the teacher and the extent to which students are enabled to learn in the classroom and school context. Candidates will engage in a process of critical reflection and inquiry to adjust their teaching based on student outcomes. This course introduces candidates to content and skills that will be built upon throughout the remainder of the MAT, and focuses on the “how” of facilitating learning at the classroom level. <br><br><a id="1" class="comment" name="1" href="#">Close Course</a> </div>
